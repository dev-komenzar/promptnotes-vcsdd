**Scope**: UI/orchestration layer for the right-pane editor only. The editor renders one Note as a vertical stack of contenteditable Block elements and translates user input (typing / Enter / Backspace / `/` menu / drag-and-drop / focus changes) into the typed `CaptureCommand` set defined by the block-based contract. It does NOT contain business validation rules; those live in `NoteOps` and `EditingSessionTransitions`. This feature consumes existing `FocusBlock`, `EditBlockContent`, `InsertBlock`, `RemoveBlock`, `MergeBlocks`, `SplitBlock`, `ChangeBlockType`, `MoveBlock`, `TriggerIdleSave`, `TriggerBlurSave`, `CopyNoteBody`, `RequestNewNote`, `RetrySave`, `DiscardCurrentSession`, and `CancelSwitch` commands verbatim — it never invents new variants.

---

## 1. Feature Overview

The `ui-editor` feature renders and orchestrates the note editor panel — the primary capture surface of the application. It presents a Notion-style block editor: each `Block` of the active `Note` is rendered as its own focusable contenteditable element inside a single editor surface. The editor tracks per-block focus, dispatches block-level commands per keystroke / Enter / Backspace / `/` menu / drag, schedules debounced idle autosaves and blur autosaves, displays saving state feedback, and handles save-failure recovery. Two supporting actions — copy body to clipboard and create a new note — are surfaced as buttons (with keyboard shortcuts).

The editor is an orchestration-only component. All business rules — block invariants (`removeBlock` last-block protection, `mergeBlockWithPrevious` first-block guard, `splitBlock` offset range, `BlockContent` constraints), serialisation (`serializeBlocksToMarkdown`), persistence, tag invariants, and `note.isEmpty()` — are delegated to domain functions invoked via Tauri IPC. The editor's sole responsibilities are: (a) translating user input events into the correct `CaptureCommand` with the correct `noteId` / `blockId` / `source` fields, (b) reflecting `EditingSessionState` transitions (including `focusedBlockId`) in the UI without mutating state directly, and (c) surfacing domain error responses as user-recoverable affordances.

**In scope:**
- Block-tree rendering: one focusable contenteditable element per `Block`, ordered by `note.blocks`
- Per-block focus management with `EditingState.focusedBlockId` mirroring (REQ-EDIT-001)
- Per-keystroke `EditBlockContent` dispatch (REQ-EDIT-003)
- Enter / Backspace / `/` menu / Markdown shortcut handling that maps to `InsertBlock` / `SplitBlock` / `MergeBlocks` / `RemoveBlock` / `ChangeBlockType` (REQ-EDIT-006..010)
- Drag-and-drop or keyboard reordering mapping to `MoveBlock` (REQ-EDIT-011)
- Idle-debounce autosave (`IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS = 2000`) and blur autosave (`EditorBlurredAllBlocks` trigger)
- `EditingSessionState` UI mapping for all 5 states: `idle`, `editing`, `saving`, `switching`, `save-failed`
- Save-failure banner with Retry / Discard / Cancel actions; Cancel restores the prior `focusedBlockId`
- Copy Body button (`CopyNoteBody` command, Workflow 6) — derives clipboard text from `serializeBlocksToMarkdown(note.blocks)` server-side
- New Note button and Ctrl+N / Cmd+N shortcut (`RequestNewNote` command); new note focuses the first block (`focusedBlockId = firstBlockId` from `NewNoteAutoCreated`)
- Source discrimination: every save command carries `source: 'capture-idle' | 'capture-blur'`

**Out of scope (belong to other features):**
- List pane / feed note rows and per-row actions (`ui-feed-list-actions`)
- Detail metadata column (tag chips, timestamps) (`ui-tag-chip`, `ui-app-shell`)
- Settings / Vault configuration modal (`configure-vault`, `ui-app-shell`)
- Cross-note search box and tag filter sidebar (`ui-filter-search`)
- Markdown ↔ Block parsing/serialisation correctness — verified by `app-startup` (Hydration) and `capture-auto-save` (serialise) features
- Backend Rust handlers and atomic file writes — covered by `capture-auto-save` / `handle-save-failure`

---

## 2. Stakeholders & Personas

**Primary persona: Note-taker (the only user in MVP)**

The note-taker launches the app to capture prompt ideas or prose quickly, then copies the body into an AI tool. Key concerns:

- Zero friction between opening the app and typing: focus must land in a Block automatically (the first block of the active note, or the first block of a freshly created empty note).
- Block typing must feel native to a Notion-style editor: Enter splits the current block, Backspace at start merges with the previous, `/` opens a block-type menu, `# `/`- `/`> ` etc. convert via `ChangeBlockType`.
- Never lose a draft: autosave must be silent and reliable; failures must be recoverable without losing block content or focus.
- Instant copy: a single click copies the full body (`serializeBlocksToMarkdown(note.blocks)`) without frontmatter contamination.
- Minimal chrome: the editor must not show distracting chrome when saving is proceeding normally; the save-failure banner appears only on error.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements (EARS)

### §3.1 Block Focus and Per-Block Editing

#### REQ-EDIT-001: Block Focus Dispatches FocusBlock and Updates focusedBlockId

When the user clicks into a Block element, or moves the caret into a Block via keyboard navigation (Tab / Arrow / programmatic focus), the system shall dispatch a `FocusBlock { kind: 'focus-block', noteId, blockId, issuedAt }` command. The mirrored `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` becomes `blockId` once the domain emits the corresponding `BlockFocused` Internal Event and the resulting `EditingState` snapshot arrives via the inbound channel (§10). (ref: capture/commands.ts `FocusBlock`; capture/internal-events.ts `BlockFocused`; capture/states.ts `EditingState.focusedBlockId`; aggregates.md §1 Block Focus)

**Edge Cases**:
- Focus changes within the same Note are NOT note-switches: `EditingSessionTransitions.refocusBlockSameNote` keeps `status === 'editing'` and continues the idle timer (REQ-EDIT-018).
- A focus event into a Block that belongs to a different Note triggers the `EditPastNoteStart` workflow (Workflow 3) via `BlockFocusRequest{ noteId, blockId, snapshot }`; that path is owned by the feed feature, not by `ui-editor`.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clicking a Block element dispatches `FocusBlock` with the matching `(noteId, blockId)` exactly once per focus transition.
- The Block element corresponding to `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` carries the visible focus ring (DESIGN.md §8 Focus System).
- The UI never sets `focusedBlockId` locally; it reads the field from `EditorViewState` mirrored from the domain snapshot.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-002: focusedBlockId is Read-Only Mirror of EditingState

The `editorReducer` shall mirror `EditingState.focusedBlockId` from incoming domain snapshots and shall NOT author new values. Optimistic local focus changes are limited to the impure shell setting native DOM focus on a Block element; the canonical `focusedBlockId` is owned by the Rust domain. The UI converges within one inbound event cycle. (ref: §3.4a; capture/states.ts `EditingState.focusedBlockId: BlockId | null`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `editorReducer({ kind: 'DomainSnapshotReceived', snapshot: S }).state.focusedBlockId === S.focusedBlockId` for every snapshot `S` of status `editing`.
- No `editorReducer` action other than `DomainSnapshotReceived` overwrites `focusedBlockId`.
- No Svelte component constructs an `EditingState` carrying a synthetic `focusedBlockId`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-003: Block Content Edit Dispatches EditBlockContent

When the user types inside the focused Block element, the system shall dispatch `EditBlockContent { kind: 'edit-block-content', noteId, blockId, content, issuedAt }` per input event, where `content` is the full current raw string of the focused Block (sent as raw `string` at the wire boundary — Rust runs `BlockContentSmartCtor.tryNew` or `tryNewMultiline` per §11). The dispatch sets `EditorViewState.isDirty=true` after the domain snapshot returns. (ref: capture/commands.ts `EditBlockContent`; capture/internal-events.ts `BlockContentEdited`; aggregates.md §1 editBlockContent)

**Edge Cases**:
- For a `code` Block, the wire-format `content` may include embedded newlines; the multi-line variant of the Smart Constructor is used Rust-side. The TypeScript wire type is the same `string`.
- For non-`code` Blocks, embedded newline characters in a single input event are reinterpreted by the Rust Smart Constructor as `BlockContentError.kind === 'newline-in-inline'`. The UI treats this as a domain validation error (REQ-EDIT-027).
- Per-character debounce on command dispatch is not required; debounce applies only to the save trigger.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each `input` event in a Block dispatches exactly one `EditBlockContent` carrying the full current Block content.
- `isDirty` is `true` after the resulting `BlockContentEdited` action is processed by `editorReducer`, mirrored from `EditingState.isDirty`.
- The dispatch reuses the focused Block's `(noteId, blockId)` pair from `EditorViewState`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-004: isDirty Reset After Successful Save

When the domain emits `NoteFileSaved` (received by the `editorReducer` as a snapshot transition `saving → editing` with `isDirty=false`), the reducer shall set `EditorViewState.isDirty=false`, and any pending idle debounce timer shall be cleared via the impure shell reacting to a `'cancel-idle-timer'` `EditorCommand` in the reducer output. (ref: aggregates.md L274 `saving + NoteFileSaved → isDirty=false`; verification-architecture.md §10 EditorCommand union)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `EditorViewState.isDirty === false` after the `SaveSuccess` action.
- The idle debounce timer is cancelled before the next edit cycle.
- `EditorViewState.isDirty` remains `true` on `NoteSaveFailed` (save failure does not clear dirty).

---

#### REQ-EDIT-005: Empty Note Predicate — Copy Button Disable

If `note.isEmpty()` is true (i.e., `blocks.length === 1 && BlockContent.isEmpty(blocks[0].content) && blocks[0].type === 'paragraph'`), then the system shall disable the Copy Body button. The pure UI predicate `canCopy(view, status)` reads the local mirror `isNoteEmpty: boolean` field from `EditorViewState`; that field is set by the `editorReducer` when mirroring an `EditingSessionState` snapshot (the snapshot's owner Rust domain runs `NoteOps.isEmpty`). (ref: aggregates.md §1 `isEmpty`; shared/note.ts `NoteOps.isEmpty`; shared/value-objects.ts `BlockContentSmartCtor.isEmpty`; ui-fields.md §1A-1; §11)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When `EditorViewState.isNoteEmpty === true`, the Copy Body button is rendered with `disabled` and `aria-disabled="true"`.
- When `EditorViewState.isNoteEmpty === false`, the Copy Body button is enabled (subject to status — REQ-EDIT-022).
- The disabled visual uses Warm Gray 300 (`#a39e98`) per DESIGN.md §8.

---

### §3.2 Block Structure Operations

#### REQ-EDIT-006: Enter at End of Block Dispatches InsertBlock

When the user presses Enter while the caret is at the end of a Block's content (`selection.start === selection.end === content.length`), the system shall dispatch `InsertBlock { kind: 'insert-block', atBeginning: false, noteId, prevBlockId, type: 'paragraph', content: '', issuedAt }` and the new Block shall receive focus (the domain emits `BlockInserted` followed by `BlockFocused`; the UI mirrors `focusedBlockId`). (ref: capture/commands.ts `InsertBlock`; aggregates.md §1 `insertBlockAfter`; workflows.md Workflow 10)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Enter at the end of a non-empty Block dispatches `InsertBlock` with `atBeginning: false` and `prevBlockId === EditorViewState.focusedBlockId`.
- The newly inserted Block becomes the focused Block once the snapshot returns.
- The newly inserted Block's `type` defaults to `'paragraph'`; `content` is empty.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-007: Enter Mid-Block Dispatches SplitBlock

When the user presses Enter while the caret is strictly inside a Block (`selection.start === selection.end ∈ (0, content.length)`), the system shall dispatch `SplitBlock { kind: 'split-block', noteId, blockId, offset, issuedAt }` where `offset` is the caret index. The text after the caret moves into a new `paragraph` Block inserted directly after, and focus moves to that new Block. (ref: capture/commands.ts `SplitBlock`; capture/internal-events.ts `BlockSplit`; aggregates.md §1 `splitBlock`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Enter mid-block dispatches `SplitBlock` carrying the caret offset.
- The reducer never invents an offset value out of `[0, content.length]`; the impure shell reads it from `Selection.anchorOffset`.
- After the resulting `BlockSplit` snapshot, `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` matches the newly created Block (`BlockSplit.newBlockId`).

---

#### REQ-EDIT-008: Backspace at Block Start Dispatches MergeBlocks

When the user presses Backspace at the start of a non-first Block (`selection.start === selection.end === 0`), the system shall dispatch `MergeBlocks { kind: 'merge-blocks', noteId, blockId, issuedAt }`. The domain merges the current Block's content into the previous Block and removes the current Block (`BlocksMerged` event); focus follows to the survivor. Backspace at the start of the first Block is a no-op (the domain returns `merge-on-first-block` and the UI treats it silently). (ref: capture/commands.ts `MergeBlocks`; capture/internal-events.ts `BlocksMerged`; aggregates.md §1 `mergeBlockWithPrevious`; shared/note.ts `BlockOperationError.merge-on-first-block`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Backspace at offset 0 in a non-first Block dispatches `MergeBlocks`.
- After the snapshot, `focusedBlockId` mirrors `BlocksMerged.survivorBlockId`.
- Backspace at offset 0 in the first Block dispatches nothing (the UI gates this client-side via `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId === blocks[0].id`).

---

#### REQ-EDIT-009: Empty-Block Backspace / Delete Dispatches RemoveBlock

When the user presses Backspace or Delete on a Block whose content is empty AND the Note has more than one Block, the system shall dispatch `RemoveBlock { kind: 'remove-block', noteId, blockId, issuedAt }`. If the Note has only one Block, the command is NOT dispatched (the domain refuses `last-block-cannot-be-removed`; the UI elides the no-op). Focus moves to the previous Block when one exists, otherwise to the next Block. (ref: capture/commands.ts `RemoveBlock`; aggregates.md §1 `removeBlock` invariant; shared/note.ts `BlockOperationError.last-block-cannot-be-removed`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Backspace/Delete on an empty non-last Block dispatches `RemoveBlock`.
- Backspace/Delete on the only Block of a Note dispatches nothing.
- After the snapshot, `focusedBlockId` matches the neighbouring Block produced by the domain.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-010: Slash Menu and Markdown Shortcut Dispatch ChangeBlockType

When the user invokes the `/` menu inside a Block and selects a Block type, OR types a recognised Markdown prefix at the start of an empty paragraph (`# ` → heading-1, `## ` → heading-2, `### ` → heading-3, `- ` / `* ` → bullet, `1. ` → numbered, `` ` `` `` ` `` `` ` `` → code, `> ` → quote, `---` as the entire Block content → divider), the system shall dispatch `ChangeBlockType { kind: 'change-block-type', noteId, blockId, newType, issuedAt }`. For Markdown shortcuts, the trigger characters are stripped from the Block content via a follow-up `EditBlockContent` dispatch (or the domain returns the cleaned content via `BlockTypeChanged`; UI mirrors). The slash menu surface itself is purely local UI state and never persists. (ref: capture/commands.ts `ChangeBlockType`; capture/internal-events.ts `BlockTypeChanged`; aggregates.md §1 `changeBlockType`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Selecting "Heading 1" in the slash menu dispatches `ChangeBlockType` with `newType: 'heading-1'`.
- Typing `# ` at the start of an empty paragraph dispatches `ChangeBlockType` with `newType: 'heading-1'` and clears the prefix.
- Each of `paragraph | heading-1 | heading-2 | heading-3 | bullet | numbered | code | quote | divider` is reachable from the slash menu and is a valid `BlockType` literal.
- The slash-menu DOM is mounted only while open and torn down on selection or Escape.
- **Divider recognition rule**: `classifyMarkdownPrefix` returns `{ newType: 'divider', trimmedContent: '' }` iff the Block content is exactly `'---'` (no surrounding whitespace, no trailing characters). Any input beginning with `---` but not equal to `'---'` (e.g. `'---more'`, `'--- '`) returns `null` and does NOT dispatch `ChangeBlockType`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-011: Block Reorder Dispatches MoveBlock

When the user drags a Block handle to a new vertical position OR uses the keyboard shortcut Alt+Shift+Up/Down to move the focused Block, the system shall dispatch `MoveBlock { kind: 'move-block', noteId, blockId, toIndex, issuedAt }` where `toIndex` is the new 0-based index in `note.blocks` and `0 <= toIndex < blocks.length`. (ref: capture/commands.ts `MoveBlock`; capture/internal-events.ts `BlockMoved`; aggregates.md §1 `moveBlock`; shared/note.ts `BlockOperationError.move-index-out-of-range`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Drop releases or Alt+Shift+Up/Down dispatches `MoveBlock` with a `toIndex` inside `[0, blocks.length)`.
- The UI reads the source index from the focused Block and the destination index from the drop target / keyboard direction; it does not invent indices outside the Note.
- The drag preview Element is removed from the DOM regardless of dispatch outcome.

---

### §3.3 Idle Autosave

#### REQ-EDIT-012: Idle Debounce Timer

**Spec contract constant**: `IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS = 2000`

When any block-edit command (`EditBlockContent`, `InsertBlock`, `RemoveBlock`, `MergeBlocks`, `SplitBlock`, `ChangeBlockType`, `MoveBlock`) is dispatched while `EditorViewState.isDirty === true`, the impure shell shall (re)start a debounce timer of exactly `IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS` ms. If no further block-edit dispatch occurs before the timer fires, the system shall fire `TriggerIdleSave { kind: 'trigger-idle-save', noteId, issuedAt }` (Workflow 2) with effective `source: 'capture-idle'` (carried on the resulting `SaveNoteRequested` Public Event). Each new block-edit dispatch resets the timer. (ref: capture/commands.ts `TriggerIdleSave`; shared/events.ts `SaveNoteSource = 'capture-idle' | 'capture-blur' | 'curate-tag-chip' | 'curate-frontmatter-edit-outside-editor'`; workflows.md Workflow 2 step 1; aggregates.md §EditingState `applyBlockEdit`)

**Debounce shell contract**: The pure `debounceSchedule.computeNextFireAt({ lastEditAt, lastSaveAt, debounceMs, nowMs })` is invoked by the impure shell. The reducer never schedules timers; it only emits `'cancel-idle-timer'` and `'trigger-idle-save'` `EditorCommand`s for the impure shell to consume. (See §12 Debounce Contract.)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- After any block-edit dispatch, exactly one `TriggerIdleSave` fires `IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS` ms after the last dispatch.
- A subsequent block-edit dispatch within the window resets the timer; no intermediate `TriggerIdleSave` fires.
- `IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS` is a named exported constant so tests use `vi.useFakeTimers()`.
- The timer is not started while `EditorViewState.isDirty === false`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-013: Idle Timer Cancelled on Successful Save

When a save completes successfully (per REQ-EDIT-004), the system shall cancel any running idle debounce timer so that `TriggerIdleSave` does not fire redundantly after the save. (ref: workflows.md Workflow 2 「重複保存抑制」)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- After `NoteFileSaved` is mirrored, the impure shell calls `cancelIdleSave(handle)` exactly once before the next edit cycle.
- A second `TriggerIdleSave` is not dispatched for a body that was already saved.

---

### §3.4 Blur Autosave

#### REQ-EDIT-014: All-Blocks Blur Fires TriggerBlurSave

When the editor surface as a whole loses focus while `EditorViewState.isDirty === true` — i.e., the impure shell observes that the focusout target is outside the editor pane root and no following focus into another Block of the same Note has arrived within the same event loop tick — the system shall dispatch `TriggerBlurSave { kind: 'trigger-blur-save', noteId, issuedAt }` (Workflow 2) with effective `source: 'capture-blur'`, and shall cancel any pending idle debounce timer. (ref: capture/commands.ts `TriggerBlurSave`; capture/internal-events.ts `EditorBlurredAllBlocks`; shared/events.ts `SaveNoteSource`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Blur to outside the editor pane while dirty dispatches `TriggerBlurSave` exactly once with effective `source: 'capture-blur'`.
- A blur from one Block followed by a focus into another Block of the same Note (same event loop tick) does NOT dispatch `TriggerBlurSave`; the editor remains in `editing` and `focusedBlockId` updates via REQ-EDIT-001.
- The pending idle timer is cancelled before `TriggerBlurSave` fires.
- If `EditorViewState.isDirty === false` at the time of all-blocks blur, `TriggerBlurSave` is NOT dispatched.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-015: Blur Does Not Duplicate Idle for the Same Dirty Interval

When `TriggerBlurSave` is dispatched, the system shall ensure the idle debounce timer is cancelled so that `TriggerIdleSave` does NOT also fire for the same dirty interval. Blur and idle MUST NOT both fire for the same dirty editing session. (ref: workflows.md Workflow 2 未解決の問い)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given an idle timer is pending, an all-blocks blur cancels it and dispatches only `TriggerBlurSave`.
- After the save completes, a fresh dirty cycle (`isDirty: false → true`) starts a new debounce window.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-016: Blur Does Not Fire When State Is Already Saving or Switching

If the all-blocks blur event arrives while `EditorViewState.status === 'saving'` or `'switching'`, the system shall NOT dispatch a second `TriggerBlurSave` because a save is already in flight (or the domain's `EditPastNoteStart.flushCurrentSession` step owns the flush). (ref: capture/states.ts; aggregates.md state transition table — `saving` / `switching` have no outgoing `EditorBlurredAllBlocks`-driven autosave)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Blur while `status === 'saving'` dispatches nothing.
- Blur while `status === 'switching'` dispatches nothing; the in-flight switch proceeds.

---

### §3.5 Block Focus Maintenance Across Same-Note Moves

#### REQ-EDIT-017: Same-Note Block Focus Does Not Begin a Switch

When the user moves focus to a different Block of the same Note, `EditingSessionTransitions.refocusBlockSameNote` keeps `status === 'editing'` and only updates `focusedBlockId`. The UI shall NOT dispatch any save command, NOT cancel the idle timer, and NOT show any switching affordance. (ref: capture/states.ts `EditingSessionTransitions.refocusBlockSameNote`; capture/stages.ts `CurrentSessionDecision.same-note`; aggregates.md L355)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A focus change between Blocks of the same Note dispatches only `FocusBlock` (REQ-EDIT-001).
- No `TriggerBlurSave` or `TriggerIdleSave` is dispatched as a result of the focus move alone.
- The visible focus ring moves; no spinner or banner appears.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-018: Idle Timer Continues Across Same-Note Block Moves

When the user moves focus to another Block of the same Note while the idle timer is pending, the timer SHALL continue running (a same-note move is not a new edit and does not reset the debounce window). The next block-edit dispatch (REQ-EDIT-003 or any structural REQ-EDIT-006..011) does reset the timer per REQ-EDIT-012. (ref: aggregates.md L355–356; capture/states.ts `applyBlockEdit`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Tab/click between Blocks does not call `cancelIdleSave` and does not call `scheduleIdleSave`.
- A subsequent `EditBlockContent` dispatch in the new focused Block resets the timer per REQ-EDIT-012.

---

### §3.6 EditingSessionState UI Mapping

#### REQ-EDIT-019: Idle State — Editor Collapsed

While `EditorViewState.status === 'idle'`, the system shall render the editor area in a collapsed/read-only placeholder state: no Block elements are interactive, the Copy button is disabled, no save indicator is shown. The placeholder text communicates that no note is active. (ref: ui-fields.md §UI 状態と型の対応 `idle` 行)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When `status === 'idle'`, the Block tree is either absent from the DOM or rendered with `contenteditable="false"` and `aria-disabled="true"`.
- The Copy button has `disabled` and `aria-disabled="true"`.
- A placeholder message is visible (e.g., "ノートを選択してください").
- The New Note button remains enabled in `idle` state.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-020: Editing State — Active Block Editing

While `EditorViewState.status === 'editing'`, the system shall render the Block tree as interactive: the Block matching `focusedBlockId` is contenteditable and carries the focus ring; non-focused Blocks remain contenteditable but visually de-emphasised per DESIGN.md. When `EditorViewState.isDirty === true`, a dirty indicator is displayed near the editor heading. No save-failure banner is shown. (ref: ui-fields.md §UI 状態と型の対応 `editing` 行; DESIGN.md §4 Inputs & Forms; aggregates.md L274 `EditingSessionState.isDirty`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The Block whose `id === EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` is the active editable element.
- When `isDirty === true`, a visual dirty indicator is present in the DOM.
- The Copy button is enabled when `isNoteEmpty === false` (REQ-EDIT-005).
- No spinner and no error banner is shown.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-021: Saving State — In-Flight Indicator

While `EditorViewState.status === 'saving'`, the system shall render a save-in-progress indicator near the editor heading, keep the Block tree editable (the user may continue typing during save), and show the Copy button enabled when `isNoteEmpty === false`. The system shall NOT make the Block tree `contenteditable="false"` during `saving`. The New Note button is **enabled** in `saving` state (per EC-EDIT-010). (ref: ui-fields.md §UI 状態と型の対応 `saving` 行)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- A save indicator element is present in the DOM with `aria-label` containing "保存中".
- Block elements remain `contenteditable="true"`.
- The dirty badge may or may not be shown; the saving indicator takes precedence.
- The New Note button is enabled.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-022: Switching State — Block Tree Locked

While `EditorViewState.status === 'switching'`, the system shall render the Block tree as non-interactive (`contenteditable="false"` and `aria-disabled="true"`) with a visual cue indicating a note switch is pending. The Copy button and New Note button shall be disabled. The user cannot make new edits until the switch completes. The pending Block focus target is `EditorViewState.pendingNextFocus = { noteId, blockId }`; the editor uses this only for visual feedback. (ref: ui-fields.md §UI 状態と型の対応 `switching` 行; capture/states.ts `SwitchingState.pendingNextFocus`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Block elements have `contenteditable="false"` and `aria-disabled="true"`.
- The Copy button is disabled.
- The New Note button is `disabled` / `aria-disabled="true"`.
- A visual cue communicates the pending switch.

#### REQ-EDIT-023: Save-Failed State — Banner and Degraded Editor

While `EditorViewState.status === 'save-failed'`, the system shall render the save-failure banner (§3.7), keep the Block tree editable, and disable the Copy button. Input continues to accumulate as pending dirty content. The New Note button is **enabled** in `save-failed` state (per EC-EDIT-008 the dispatch is allowed; the domain's `HandleSaveFailure` decides). The banner Cancel button restores focus to the block identified by `EditingSessionStateDto.save-failed.priorFocusedBlockId` (a DTO-only projection field; see §10). (ref: ui-fields.md §UI 状態と型の対応 `save-failed` 行; capture/states.ts `SaveFailedState.pendingNextFocus`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The save-failure banner is visible.
- Block elements remain `contenteditable="true"`.
- The Copy button is `disabled` / `aria-disabled="true"`.
- The New Note button is enabled.

---

#### §3.6a State Ownership Contract

**This subsection is normative.** It resolves the state-ownership ambiguity carried over from prior iterations.

**Canonical `EditingSessionState`** is owned exclusively by the Rust domain layer. The TypeScript `editorReducer` is a **mirror reducer** whose output type is `EditorViewState` — a UI-side projection derived from inbound `EditingSessionState` snapshot events.

**Relationship between `EditorViewState` and `EditingSessionState`**:
- `EditorViewState` is a strict subset of `EditingSessionStateDto`: it contains `status`, `isDirty`, `currentNoteId`, `focusedBlockId` (populated from `editing.focusedBlockId` or `save-failed.priorFocusedBlockId` per PROP-EDIT-014), `pendingNextFocus`, `isNoteEmpty`, `lastSaveError` (when status is `save-failed`), `lastSaveResult` (mirrored from the `editing` arm; null for all other statuses — informs the dirty indicator and post-save banner UX).
- `EditorViewState` is NOT the authoritative state. It is a locally-cached projection for UI rendering.
- The reducer's job is UI-projection only: given an inbound domain snapshot action (`DomainSnapshotReceived { snapshot }`), it produces an `EditorViewState` suitable for driving Svelte reactivity.
- Locally-observed action shapes (e.g., `BlockContentEdited` for optimistic `isDirty=true`) are immediately superseded by the next domain snapshot.

**Who emits transitions**: The Rust domain emits transitions. The TypeScript `editorReducer` does NOT author new transitions; it only reflects them into `EditorViewState`.

**Inbound event channel**: See §10 Domain ↔ UI State Synchronization.

**Invariant**: `EditorViewState` must converge to the domain's `EditingSessionState` within one inbound event cycle. Any divergence (e.g., optimistic `isDirty=true`) is transient and overwritten by the next `DomainSnapshotReceived`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-024: State Transitions Are Domain-Driven

The system shall NOT mutate `EditingSessionState` or `EditorViewState` directly from UI event handlers other than via the `editorReducer`. All canonical state transitions are driven by domain events received via the inbound `editing_session_state_changed` Tauri event channel (§10). The Svelte component calls `editorReducer` with an `EditorAction` and renders the returned `EditorViewState`; it never constructs `EditingSessionState`. (ref: aggregates.md CaptureSession 設計原則; ui-fields.md Phase 11 差し戻し)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No Svelte component constructs or mutates an `EditingSessionState` object.
- The canonical state flows from the domain layer via `EditorIpcAdapter.subscribeToState(handler)` (§10).
- The UI re-renders reactively when the `$state`-stored `EditorViewState` is updated by the inbound event callback.
- The `editorReducer` is the only code that produces a new `EditorViewState` from an `EditorAction`.

---

### §3.7 Save-Failure Banner

#### REQ-EDIT-025: Save-Failure Banner Rendered for save-failed State

When `EditorViewState.status === 'save-failed'`, the system shall render a non-modal inline banner within the editor area displaying a user-facing error message derived from `SaveError.kind`. (ref: ui-fields.md §画面 4; workflows.md Workflow 8; shared/errors.ts `SaveError`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The banner is present in the DOM if and only if `status === 'save-failed'`.
- The banner does not use a blocking modal overlay; it is inline.
- The banner has `role="alert"` and `data-testid="save-failure-banner"`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-026: Save-Failure Banner Message Derived From SaveError.kind

When the save-failure banner is rendered, the system shall display a message corresponding to the `SaveError` nested structure, drawn verbatim from `ui-fields.md §画面 4`:

| `SaveError` structure | User-facing message |
|---|---|
| `{ kind: 'fs', reason: { kind: 'permission' } }` | 「保存に失敗しました（権限不足）」 |
| `{ kind: 'fs', reason: { kind: 'disk-full' } }` | 「保存に失敗しました（ディスク容量不足）」 |
| `{ kind: 'fs', reason: { kind: 'lock' } }` | 「保存に失敗しました（ファイルがロックされています）」 |
| `{ kind: 'fs', reason: { kind: 'not-found' } }` | 「保存に失敗しました（保存先が見つかりません）」 |
| `{ kind: 'fs', reason: { kind: 'unknown' } }` | 「保存に失敗しました」（詳細はログ） |
| `{ kind: 'validation', reason: { kind: 'empty-body-on-idle' } }` | サイレント（破棄パスへ、バナー非表示）。後継状態: `EditorViewState.status === 'editing'`、`isDirty === false`、`isNoteEmpty === true`、idle debounce タイマーはクリア。以降の block-edit は通常サイクルを再開 |
| `{ kind: 'validation', reason: { kind: 'invariant-violated' } }` | 内部バグ: エラーログのみ、バナー非表示（サイレント） |

(ref: shared/errors.ts `FsError` / `SaveError` / `SaveValidationError`; ui-fields.md §画面 4)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each `fs` error kind maps to the exact user-facing message string above.
- `validation.invariant-violated` does NOT render the banner; it logs to `console.error` and leaves the UI unchanged.
- `validation.empty-body-on-idle` does NOT render the banner; the successor `EditorViewState` has `status === 'editing'`, `isDirty === false`, `isNoteEmpty === true`, and the idle debounce timer is cleared.
- The TypeScript switch over `SaveError.kind` and `FsError.kind` is exhaustive (compile-time `never` guarantee).
- The message element has `data-testid="save-failure-message"`.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-027: Save-Failure Banner — Retry Button

When the save-failure banner is visible, the system shall render a 再試行 (Retry) button. When the user activates it, the system shall dispatch `RetrySave { kind: 'retry-save', noteId, issuedAt }`, transitioning the domain from `save-failed` to `saving`. (ref: capture/commands.ts `RetrySave`; capture/states.ts `EditingSessionTransitions.retry`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The Retry button is present and labeled "再試行" when `status === 'save-failed'`.
- Activating the button dispatches `RetrySave` exactly once.
- The button has `data-testid="retry-save-button"`, is keyboard-reachable, and activatable via Enter/Space.
- After dispatch, the banner hides via the `saving` snapshot.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-028: Save-Failure Banner — Discard Button

When the save-failure banner is visible, the system shall render a 破棄 (Discard) button. Activating it dispatches `DiscardCurrentSession { kind: 'discard-current-session', noteId, issuedAt }`. If `EditorViewState.pendingNextFocus` is non-null, the domain `EditingSessionTransitions.discard` returns an `EditingState` for the queued next Block Focus; otherwise it returns `IdleState`. (ref: capture/commands.ts `DiscardCurrentSession`; capture/states.ts `EditingSessionTransitions.discard`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The Discard button is present and labeled "変更を破棄" when `status === 'save-failed'`.
- Activating the button dispatches `DiscardCurrentSession` exactly once.
- The button has `data-testid="discard-session-button"`, is keyboard-reachable, and activatable via Enter/Space.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-029: Save-Failure Banner — Cancel Button

When the save-failure banner is visible, the system shall render a キャンセル (Cancel) button. Activating it dispatches `CancelSwitch { kind: 'cancel-switch', noteId, issuedAt }`, which returns the domain to `editing(currentNoteId, focusedBlockId)` — the user continues editing the prior Block. (ref: capture/commands.ts `CancelSwitch`; capture/states.ts `EditingSessionTransitions.cancelSwitch`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The Cancel button is present and labeled "閉じる（このまま編集を続ける）" when `status === 'save-failed'`.
- Activating the button dispatches `CancelSwitch` exactly once.
- The button has `data-testid="cancel-switch-button"`, is keyboard-reachable, and activatable via Enter/Space.
- After dispatch, the banner hides and the block identified by `EditingSessionStateDto.save-failed.priorFocusedBlockId` regains the visible focus ring (restored via the `$effect` reacting to `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` after the snapshot transitions back to `editing`).

---

#### REQ-EDIT-030: Save-Failure Banner Visual Style

When the save-failure banner is rendered, the system shall style it as a Deep Card (Level 3) overlay using the 5-layer Deep Shadow, with a left accent border in Orange (`#dd5b00`). All three action buttons must be DESIGN.md-compliant. (ref: DESIGN.md §4 Cards & Containers; §6 Depth & Elevation; §4 Buttons)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The banner container uses the 5-layer Deep Shadow: `rgba(0,0,0,0.01) 0px 1px 3px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 3px 7px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 7px 15px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 14px 28px, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 23px 52px`.
- The left accent uses `#dd5b00`.
- The banner `border-radius` is 8px.
- Retry button uses Primary Blue (`#0075de` background, white text); Discard and Cancel use Secondary style.
- Button text is 15px weight 600.

---

### §3.8 Copy Body

#### REQ-EDIT-031: Copy Button Dispatches CopyNoteBody

When the user activates the Copy Body button and `EditorViewState.isNoteEmpty === false`, the system shall dispatch `CopyNoteBody { kind: 'copy-note-body', noteId, issuedAt }`. The Rust handler invokes `NoteOps.bodyForClipboard(note)` (which internally calls `serializeBlocksToMarkdown(note.blocks)`) and writes the result to the clipboard. (ref: capture/commands.ts `CopyNoteBody`; shared/note.ts `NoteOps.bodyForClipboard`; shared/blocks.ts `SerializeBlocksToMarkdown`; workflows.md Workflow 6)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Activating the Copy button dispatches `CopyNoteBody` with the active `noteId`.
- `CopyNoteBody` is NOT dispatched when `EditorViewState.isNoteEmpty === true`.
- The button has `data-testid="copy-body-button"`, is keyboard-reachable, and activatable via Enter/Space.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-032: Copy Button Disabled State Matrix

The Copy button disabled rule across all 5 statuses:
- `idle` → **disabled** (no active note)
- `editing` → **enabled** when `isNoteEmpty === false`; disabled otherwise
- `saving` → **enabled** when `isNoteEmpty === false`; disabled otherwise
- `switching` → **disabled** (input locked)
- `save-failed` → **disabled**

When disabled, the button has `disabled`, `aria-disabled="true"`, text color `#a39e98`, and no hover interaction. (ref: ui-fields.md §UI 状態と型の対応; DESIGN.md §8 Disabled state)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The `disabled` attribute is present in `idle`, `switching`, `save-failed` regardless of `isNoteEmpty`.
- The `disabled` attribute is present when `isNoteEmpty === true` regardless of status.
- The Copy button text/icon uses `#a39e98` when disabled.
- No `click` handler fires while disabled.

---

### §3.9 New Note (+新規ノート)

#### REQ-EDIT-033: New Note Button Dispatches RequestNewNote

When the user activates the "+ 新規" button, the system shall dispatch `RequestNewNote { kind: 'request-new-note', source: 'explicit-button', issuedAt }` (`issuedAt` is a raw ISO-8601 string at the wire boundary — §11). (ref: capture/commands.ts `RequestNewNote`)

**New Note button enable/disable matrix**:
- `idle` → **enabled**
- `editing` → **enabled** (REQ-EDIT-035 may inject blur-save first)
- `saving` → **enabled** (per EC-EDIT-010 the domain queues the intent)
- `switching` → **disabled** (a switch is already in progress)
- `save-failed` → **enabled** (per EC-EDIT-008)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Activating "+ 新規" dispatches `RequestNewNote` with `source: 'explicit-button'`.
- The button has `data-testid="new-note-button"`.
- The button is `disabled` / `aria-disabled="true"` only in `switching` state.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-034: Ctrl+N / Cmd+N Dispatches RequestNewNote

When the user presses Ctrl+N (Linux/Windows) or Cmd+N (macOS) **while focus is within the editor pane root element** (the listener is scoped to the editor pane — NOT the global `document`), the system shall dispatch `RequestNewNote { source: 'ctrl-N', issuedAt }`. Both platforms map to the single `'ctrl-N'` source value. (ref: capture/commands.ts `RequestNewNote.source`)

**Platform detection**: `(event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) && event.key.toLowerCase() === 'n'`. The dispatched `source` is always `'ctrl-N'`.

**Listener scope**: The listener attaches to the editor pane root via `panelRoot.addEventListener('keydown', ...)`, NOT `document.addEventListener`.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Pressing `Ctrl+N` (Linux/Windows) dispatches `RequestNewNote { source: 'ctrl-N' }`.
- Pressing `Cmd+N` (macOS) dispatches `RequestNewNote { source: 'ctrl-N' }`.
- `event.preventDefault()` is called.
- The `n` character is not inserted into any Block.
- The shortcut does NOT fire when focus is outside the editor pane.

---

#### REQ-EDIT-035: New Note When Current Note Is Dirty (status === 'editing') — Blur-Save First

When `RequestNewNote` is dispatched while `EditorViewState.status === 'editing'` AND `isDirty === true`, the system shall trigger blur-save semantics first (`TriggerBlurSave { source: 'capture-blur' }` via REQ-EDIT-014's `EditorBlurredAllBlocks` path), wait for the `saving → editing` snapshot, and only then allow the domain `RequestNewNote` pipeline to create the new note. If the save fails (status becomes `save-failed`), new-note creation is deferred until the user resolves via Retry / Discard / Cancel.

**Explicit carve-out for `save-failed`**: When `status === 'save-failed'` and the user dispatches `RequestNewNote`, the UI does NOT first dispatch `TriggerBlurSave`. It dispatches `RequestNewNote { source }` directly; the domain's `HandleSaveFailure` (Workflow 8) owns resolution. (See §9 RD-009.)

(ref: ui-fields.md §1A-3; aggregates.md `EditingSessionState` `editing → switching`; workflows.md Workflow 8)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "+ 新規" / Ctrl+N while `editing` AND `isDirty === true` dispatches `TriggerBlurSave` before `RequestNewNote`.
- `RequestNewNote` is NOT dispatched until the snapshot transitions out of `saving`.
- If the snapshot becomes `save-failed`, the new-note action is suspended and the banner is shown.
- When `status === 'save-failed'`, `RequestNewNote` is dispatched directly without a preceding `TriggerBlurSave`.
- When `status === 'editing'` AND `isDirty === false`, `RequestNewNote` is dispatched directly without a preceding `TriggerBlurSave` (there is no dirty content to save). (See PROP-EDIT-024c.)

---

#### REQ-EDIT-036: New Note Auto-Focuses First Block

When `NewNoteAutoCreated { firstBlockId }` is mirrored into a snapshot (EditingState with `currentNoteId === <new>` and `focusedBlockId === firstBlockId`), the system shall set native DOM focus to the Block element matching `firstBlockId`. (ref: capture/internal-events.ts `NewNoteAutoCreated`; aggregates.md §1 `NoteOps.create`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- After `NewNoteAutoCreated` is mirrored, the Block element for `firstBlockId` receives DOM focus exactly once per creation.
- The native focus is set inside an `$effect` reacting to `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` changes — never inside the pure reducer.

---

### §3.10 Source Discrimination

#### REQ-EDIT-037: Every Save Command Carries Explicit Source

The system shall set the `source` field on every save-triggering `EditorCommand` explicitly in the UI layer. The UI MUST NOT allow the domain to infer the source. The permitted `source` values for `ui-editor` are drawn verbatim from `shared/events.ts SaveNoteSource`:

- `'capture-idle'` — idle debounce timer fired after the user stopped typing
- `'capture-blur'` — all-blocks blur (including programmatic blur-save for note-switch / new-note scenarios)

The values `'curate-tag-chip'` and `'curate-frontmatter-edit-outside-editor'` exist in the same enum but are **out of scope** for this feature. The values `'switch'`, `'manual'`, `'idle'`, and `'blur'` do NOT exist in the domain enum and MUST NOT be used. Note-switch is handled by `EditPastNoteStart` (Workflow 3), not by a distinct source. (ref: shared/events.ts `SaveNoteSource`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `TriggerIdleSave` always carries effective `source: 'capture-idle'` (carried on the `SaveNoteRequested` Public Event built by Capture from this command).
- `TriggerBlurSave` always carries effective `source: 'capture-blur'`.
- No save command is dispatched without an explicit `source` field on the resulting `EditorCommand` payload (§10 EditorCommand union).
- The strings `'idle'`, `'blur'`, `'switch'`, `'manual'` MUST NOT appear as `source` values anywhere in `ui-editor`.

---

### §3.11 Input Field Validation Surface

#### REQ-EDIT-038: Block Validation Error Display

When a `dispatchEditBlockContent`, `dispatchChangeBlockType`, `dispatchInsertBlockAfter`, or `dispatchInsertBlockAtBeginning` Promise rejects with a `BlockOperationError` or `BlockContentError`, the `EditorPanel` shall set a local `$state currentBlockError = { blockId: string; error: { kind: string; max?: number } } | null` and render the corresponding inline hint near the affected Block without locking the Block. The error is cleared when the next successful dispatch for the same block resolves OR when the user begins editing the affected block. The Block remains contenteditable throughout. The exhaustive error mapping covers (`shared/note.ts BlockOperationError`):

| Error variant | UI surface |
|---|---|
| `block-not-found` | Internal bug — `console.error`, no inline hint |
| `last-block-cannot-be-removed` | Silent (UI never dispatches RemoveBlock for last block per REQ-EDIT-009) |
| `split-offset-out-of-range` | Internal bug — `console.error` |
| `move-index-out-of-range` | Internal bug — `console.error` |
| `merge-on-first-block` | Silent (UI never dispatches MergeBlocks at first block per REQ-EDIT-008) |
| `incompatible-content-for-type` | Inline hint near Block: "このブロック種別に変換できません" |
| `invalid-block-id` / `invalid-block-type` | Internal bug — `console.error` |
| `BlockContentError.control-character` | Inline hint: "制御文字は入力できません" |
| `BlockContentError.newline-in-inline` | Internal bug — `console.error` (UI gates against newlines for non-`code` Blocks per REQ-EDIT-003) |
| `BlockContentError.too-long` | Inline hint: "上限を超えました（max: ${max}）" |

Likewise for `SaveValidationError`:
- `empty-body-on-idle` — silent (REQ-EDIT-026)
- `invariant-violated` — `console.error` only

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Inline hint area is `data-testid="block-validation-hint"` and `data-error-kind="<kind>"` near the affected Block.
- The Block is never `contenteditable="false"` solely because of a validation error.
- `currentBlockError` is local `$state` in the impure shell (`EditorPanel.svelte`) only — it is NOT part of `EditorViewState` or `EditingSessionStateDto`.
- The hint is triggered by Promise rejection from the dispatch* methods, not from the snapshot DTO.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-EDIT-001: Accessibility — Keyboard Reachability

All interactive elements — Block elements, Copy button, New Note button, Retry / Discard / Cancel — shall be reachable via Tab key navigation and activatable via Enter / Space (block elements remain in document tab order with `tabindex="0"` for non-focused blocks, or follow native contenteditable focus order). Tab order: focused Block → Copy → New Note → (when banner visible) Retry → Discard → Cancel. (ref: DESIGN.md §8 Accessibility & States)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Block elements are reachable via Tab when not currently focused.
- Buttons have descriptive `aria-label` if the visible label is insufficient.
- Focus ring uses `2px solid #097fe8`.
- ARIA verification is performed via DOM attribute assertions; no `axe-core` dependency.

---

#### NFR-EDIT-002: Accessibility — ARIA Roles and Live Regions

The save indicator shown during `saving` shall have `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`. The save-failure banner shall have `role="alert"`. The dirty indicator is `aria-hidden="true"` if decorative. Each Block element exposes `role="textbox"` (or its native equivalent for contenteditable). (ref: DESIGN.md §8)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The saving indicator has `role="status"`.
- The banner root element has `role="alert"`.
- No interactive element uses `tabIndex="-1"` while enabled.

---

#### NFR-EDIT-003: Performance — Idle Debounce Timer Overhead

The idle debounce timer uses a single `setTimeout` reference per edit cycle, not accumulating timers. On each block-edit dispatch, the previous timer is cleared before setting the new one. At typical Note sizes (up to ~50 Blocks, each up to ~5,000 chars per `BlockContentError.too-long` budget) there shall be no perceptible input lag. The reducer dispatch must complete synchronously within the event handler. (ref: REQ-EDIT-012)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The timer handle is stored in a single `$state` variable and cleared with `clearTimeout` on each new edit.
- Timer count does not grow unboundedly during a typing session.

---

#### NFR-EDIT-004: Performance — No Input Lag at Typical Note Size

The input event handler for any Block shall complete synchronously without blocking the event loop. Debounce scheduling, command dispatch, and state updates must not introduce perceptible lag. (ref: NFR-EDIT-003)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The `input` event handler completes without calling any async operation synchronously.
- No `await` inside the `oninput` handler.

---

#### NFR-EDIT-005: DESIGN.md Visual Conformance — Tokens

All hex / rgba / px values used in `ui-editor` Svelte components shall be drawn exclusively from DESIGN.md §10 Token Reference. Block elements use `font-family: -apple-system, ...` (DESIGN.md §3 Body Reading) and the body color `rgba(0,0,0,0.9)`; `code` Blocks use the monospace stack and 13px size. (ref: DESIGN.md §3 Typography; §10 Token Reference)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No hex / rgba / px value outside DESIGN.md §10 appears in component source.
- `code` Block uses `font-family: ui-monospace, ...` and `font-size: 13px`.

---

#### NFR-EDIT-006: DESIGN.md Visual Conformance — 4-Weight Typography System

All text uses only `font-weight ∈ {400, 500, 600, 700}` per DESIGN.md §3. Heading-1 / 2 / 3 Blocks use the corresponding heading weights and sizes from DESIGN.md §3.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No `font-weight` value outside `{400,500,600,700}` appears in component styles.
- `heading-1` Block matches DESIGN.md §3 H1 (28px / 700).
- `heading-2` Block matches H2 (22px / 600).
- `heading-3` Block matches H3 (18px / 600).

---

#### NFR-EDIT-007: DESIGN.md Visual Conformance — Layered Shadow on Banner

The save-failure banner uses the 5-layer Deep Shadow per DESIGN.md §6 (Deep Card Level 3). No single layer opacity exceeds 0.05. (ref: REQ-EDIT-030)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Banner `box-shadow` exactly matches the 5-layer Deep Shadow string.
- Individual shadow layer opacities ≤ 0.05.

---

#### NFR-EDIT-008: Svelte 5 Runes — State Ownership Boundary

All reactive state internal to `ui-editor` (debounce timer handle, slash-menu open/close, drag preview position) uses Svelte 5 rune syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`). `isDirty` and `focusedBlockId` are NOT local Svelte state — they are fields of `EditorViewState` (the domain mirror) read from a read-only store / prop. No `writable` stores from Svelte 4 are introduced.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Local editor-shell state uses `$state(...)`.
- `isDirty` and `focusedBlockId` are NOT local `$state` variables; they are derived from `EditorViewState`.
- No `import { writable } from 'svelte/store'` for editor-internal state. Verified by `grep -r "from 'svelte/store'" src/lib/editor/` returning zero hits.
- `EditingSessionState` is not mutated inside any `ui-editor` component. Verified by `tsc --strict --noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.

---

## 5. Edge Case Catalogue

#### EC-EDIT-001: Rapid Typing — Debounce Burst Over 10 Seconds

The user types continuously for >10s with no pause longer than `IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS`. Expected: the timer is reset on each block-edit dispatch; at last-edit + 2s, exactly one `TriggerIdleSave` fires; no intermediate saves.

---

#### EC-EDIT-002: All-Blocks Blur During In-Flight Save

Status is `saving` (write in flight) and the user moves focus outside the editor pane. Per REQ-EDIT-016, `TriggerBlurSave` is NOT dispatched. The in-flight save proceeds. The next snapshot transitions to `editing` (or `save-failed`). No double-save.

---

#### EC-EDIT-003: Save Fails, User Continues Typing While Banner Shown

Status is `save-failed`. The user keeps typing. Per REQ-EDIT-023, Block elements remain editable. Each keystroke dispatches `EditBlockContent` and `isDirty` remains `true`. The idle timer continues to run. If `TriggerIdleSave` fires while `save-failed`, the UI dispatches the command; the domain owns the retry gate. The banner remains until Retry / Discard / Cancel.

---

#### EC-EDIT-004: Discard While Save Is Mid-Flight

Status is `saving` (write in progress) and the user reaches `DiscardCurrentSession` (e.g., after a fast `save-failed → saving` Retry round). The UI dispatches `DiscardCurrentSession`; the domain handles the race. The UI does not attempt to cancel the Tauri IPC call.

---

#### EC-EDIT-005: Switching to Another Note via Block Focus While Dirty

Status is `editing` and `isDirty === true`. The user clicks a Block in another Note from the feed (the click is owned by the feed feature). The domain transitions to `switching` with `pendingNextFocus = { noteId: B, blockId: bX }`. Per REQ-EDIT-022, the editor renders the locked state; the idle timer is cancelled. `EditPastNoteStart` (`flushCurrentSession`) handles the flush. On success, the snapshot becomes `editing(B, bX)`; on failure, `save-failed` with `pendingNextFocus` carrying `{ B, bX }`.

---

#### EC-EDIT-006: Same-Note Block Move (No Switching)

Status is `editing`. The user clicks another Block of the same Note. Per REQ-EDIT-017 / REQ-EDIT-018, the snapshot updates only `focusedBlockId`; status stays `editing`; idle timer continues. No `TriggerBlurSave`, no `TriggerIdleSave` from the focus move alone.

---

#### EC-EDIT-007: Empty Note → Non-Empty Transition (Copy Enable)

The user types into the only Block of a freshly-created Note (empty paragraph). Once the Block content is non-whitespace, the domain emits a snapshot with `isNoteEmpty: false`; the Copy button transitions enabled within the same render frame. Conversely, deleting all content reverts to `isNoteEmpty: true` and disables Copy.

---

#### EC-EDIT-008: Ctrl+N Pressed While Save-Failed Banner Is Visible

Status is `save-failed`. Per RD-009, the UI dispatches `RequestNewNote { source: 'ctrl-N' }` directly without a preceding `TriggerBlurSave`. The domain's `HandleSaveFailure` (Workflow 8) owns the resolution. If the domain requires resolution first, it returns `save-failed` again and the banner remains.

---

#### EC-EDIT-009: Idle Timer Running, OS Sleeps and Resumes

A pending `setTimeout` callback fires shortly after OS resume, dispatching `TriggerIdleSave` against the latest Block snapshot. This is acceptable; no formal verification beyond unit-level timer mocks.

---

#### EC-EDIT-010: New Note Attempted While State Is saving

Status is `saving` and the user activates New Note. Per REQ-EDIT-035 + `EditPastNoteStart`, the domain queues the new-note intent (sentinel `pendingNextFocus`). The UI dispatches `RequestNewNote` and reflects the resulting `switching` state until the domain resolves. The New Note button is **enabled** in `saving` (REQ-EDIT-021 / REQ-EDIT-033).

---

#### EC-EDIT-011: Backspace at Start of First Block

The user's caret is at offset 0 of the first Block. Per REQ-EDIT-008, the UI elides the dispatch (gated client-side via `focusedBlockId === blocks[0].id`). The default browser behaviour is `event.preventDefault()`-suppressed only when the elision applies; if there is text to delete normally inside a contenteditable, the browser handles it via REQ-EDIT-003's standard input flow.

---

#### EC-EDIT-012: SplitBlock at End-of-Block (Should Use InsertBlock)

The user presses Enter at offset === content.length. Per REQ-EDIT-006 vs REQ-EDIT-007, the UI dispatches `InsertBlock` (not `SplitBlock`). This is a pure-tier classification: `splitOrInsert(offset, contentLength)` returns `'insert'` when `offset === contentLength`, otherwise `'split'`. (Tested in `editorPredicates.property.test.ts`.)

---

#### EC-EDIT-013: Unknown BlockType in Markdown Shortcut

The user types a Markdown prefix that does not match any `BlockType` literal (e.g., `~~~`). The UI dispatches no `ChangeBlockType`; standard `EditBlockContent` for the typed characters proceeds.

---

#### EC-EDIT-014: SwitchError With pendingNextFocus

A note switch save-fails. `SwitchError.pendingNextFocus = { noteId, blockId }` arrives in the `save-failed` snapshot. The Cancel button restores focus to the block identified by `EditingSessionStateDto.save-failed.priorFocusedBlockId` (the prior `currentNoteId`'s focused block, carried as a DTO-only projection field); the Discard button calls `EditingSessionTransitions.discard` which the domain may resolve to an `EditingState` for the queued `pendingNextFocus`. (ref: shared/errors.ts `SwitchError`; capture/states.ts `SaveFailedState.pendingNextFocus`)

## 7. Purity Boundary Candidates

The following behaviours are **pure** (deterministic, side-effect-free, formally verifiable) and seed Phase 1b proof obligations:

- **Block focus mirroring**: `editorReducer` mirrors `EditingState.focusedBlockId` from `DomainSnapshotReceived`; pure projection.
- **Optimistic dirty bit**: A locally-observed `BlockContentEdited` action sets `isDirty=true` until the next snapshot supersedes; pure derivation.
- **Source classification**: `classifySource(triggerKind: 'idle' | 'blur'): 'capture-idle' | 'capture-blur'` — pure mapping. Within `ui-editor` only these two values are produced; `'curate-*'` are produced by the Curate context.
- **Copy-enable predicate**: `canCopy(view): boolean = !view.isNoteEmpty && view.status !== 'idle' && view.status !== 'switching' && view.status !== 'save-failed'`. Pure function.
- **Banner message derivation**: `bannerMessageFor(error: SaveError): string | null` — exhaustive switch over `SaveError` and `FsError`.
- **Splitting rule**: `splitOrInsert(offset: number, contentLength: number): 'split' | 'insert'` — pure boundary classifier (REQ-EDIT-006 vs REQ-EDIT-007; EC-EDIT-012).
- **Markdown shortcut classifier**: `classifyMarkdownPrefix(content: string): { newType: BlockType; trimmedContent: string } | null` — pure prefix → BlockType mapping. Divider rule: returns `{ newType: 'divider', trimmedContent: '' }` iff `content === '---'` exactly; any other string starting with `---` returns `null`.
- **Backspace-at-zero classifier**: `classifyBackspaceAtZero(focusedIndex: number, blockCount: number): 'merge' | 'remove-empty-noop' | 'first-block-noop' | 'normal-edit'` — pure decision, given offset 0 and the focused index.
- **Debounce schedule**: `debounceSchedule.computeNextFireAt({ lastEditAt, lastSaveAt, debounceMs, nowMs })` (pure).
- **Reducer**: `editorReducer(state: EditorViewState, action: EditorAction): { state: EditorViewState, commands: ReadonlyArray<EditorCommand> }`. Total function.

The following behaviours are **impure** (effectful, outside pure verification):

- **Timer scheduling** (`setTimeout` / `clearTimeout`): impure shell `timerModule.ts`.
- **Clipboard write** is performed by the Rust side of `CopyNoteBody`; the editor has no direct clipboard call.
- **Tauri IPC for save / commands** via `EditorIpcAdapter`.
- **DOM events** (`focusin`, `focusout`, `keydown`, `input`, drag events).
- **`$effect` rune** registering listeners on the editor pane root.
- **Native focus management** (`element.focus()`) reacting to `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` changes.
- **Inbound domain state subscription** (`EditorIpcAdapter.subscribeToState`).

---

## 8. Open Questions

- **`isNoteEmpty` mirror field source**: The `EditingSessionStateDto` payload from Rust must include a precomputed `isNoteEmpty: boolean` (running `NoteOps.isEmpty` server-side) so the UI does not re-implement the predicate. This is acceptable per §11 and is the confirmed approach — added to the inbound DTO contract in §10. No ambiguity remains; this note is retained for traceability.

_All other formerly open questions resolved; see §9._

---

## 9. Resolved Decisions

| ID | Question summary | Resolution | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| RD-001 | Permitted `source` enum values | `'capture-idle'` and `'capture-blur'` only (drawn from `shared/events.ts SaveNoteSource`). `'curate-*'` are out of scope. `'switch'`, `'manual'`, `'idle'`, `'blur'` MUST NOT be used. | shared/events.ts |
| RD-002 | `source` for `RequestNewNote` | `'explicit-button'` (button) and `'ctrl-N'` (keyboard, both platforms). | capture/commands.ts |
| RD-003 | Tauri IPC command names | `ui-editor` does NOT hard-code `invoke()` strings. It depends on the injected `EditorIpcAdapter`. Pure-tier modules MUST NOT import `@tauri-apps/api`. Concrete handler names are defined by the backend save-handler features. | verification-architecture.md §2 / §8 |
| RD-004 | Ctrl+N vs Cmd+N | `(event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) && event.key.toLowerCase() === 'n'`. Source label always `'ctrl-N'`. | REQ-EDIT-034 |
| RD-005 | `isDirty` ownership | Field of both domain `EditingSessionState` and mirrored `EditorViewState`. UI never authors transitions; superseded by the next snapshot. | aggregates.md L274; §3.6a |
| RD-006 | `note.isEmpty()` predicate at UI | UI reads `EditorViewState.isNoteEmpty` from the snapshot DTO. The Rust domain runs `NoteOps.isEmpty`. UI does not re-implement the predicate. | shared/note.ts; §11 |
| RD-007 | Successor state for `empty-body-on-idle` | After silent discard: `EditorViewState.status === 'editing'`, `isDirty === false`, `isNoteEmpty === true`, idle timer cleared. | aggregates.md L280; REQ-EDIT-026 |
| RD-008 | Ctrl+N listener scope | Editor pane root element only (NOT `document`). | REQ-EDIT-034 |
| RD-009 | REQ-EDIT-035 vs EC-EDIT-008 | When `status === 'save-failed'`, `RequestNewNote` is dispatched directly without preceding `TriggerBlurSave`. The blur-save gate applies only when `status === 'editing'` AND `isDirty === true`. | EC-EDIT-008; REQ-EDIT-035 |
| RD-010 | Reducer signature | `editorReducer(state: EditorViewState, action: EditorAction): { state: EditorViewState, commands: ReadonlyArray<EditorCommand> }`. Total. | verification-architecture.md §2 |
| RD-011 | Inbound channel name | Rust emits `editing_session_state_changed` events with payload `{ state: EditingSessionStateDto }`. Per-arm fields: `editing` carries `focusedBlockId`; `save-failed` carries `priorFocusedBlockId` (DTO-only projection); `saving` and `switching` carry neither. See §10 DTO union for the per-status field sets. | §10 |
| RD-012 | Debounce shell/pure boundary | Pure `computeNextFireAt({ lastEditAt, lastSaveAt, debounceMs, nowMs })`; impure shell calls `setTimeout`. The reducer never schedules timers; emits `'cancel-idle-timer'` / `'trigger-idle-save'` commands. | §12 |
| RD-013 | Brand-type construction at UI boundary | UI sends raw `string`/`number` over Tauri commands. Rust constructs `Body`, `BlockContent`, `BlockId`, `Timestamp`, `NoteId` via Smart Constructors. | §11 |
| RD-014 | New Note button enable matrix | `idle` enabled; `editing` enabled; `saving` enabled; `switching` disabled; `save-failed` enabled. | REQ-EDIT-033 |
| RD-015 | Same-Note Block move ≠ switch | `EditingSessionTransitions.refocusBlockSameNote` keeps `editing`; idle timer continues; no save commands fired. | REQ-EDIT-017; REQ-EDIT-018 |
| RD-016 | `tauriEditorAdapter.ts` vs `editorStateChannel.ts` split | OUTBOUND vs INBOUND only. No overlap. Phase 5 audit greps `invoke` only in adapter, `listen` only in channel. | verification-architecture.md §2 |
| RD-017 | `EditorCommand` discriminated union | 17-variant union matching the new block-based contract: 16 IPC-adapter variants + 1 local-effect variant (`cancel-idle-timer`, handled by `timerModule.cancelIdleSave` — no IPC). See verification-architecture.md §10. | verification-architecture.md §10 |
| RD-018 | `SaveFailedState` focus restoration | The Cancel button restores focus to the block identified by `EditingSessionStateDto.save-failed.priorFocusedBlockId` (a DTO-only projection field populated at the IPC emission layer from the preceding `EditingState.focusedBlockId`). `pendingNextFocus = { noteId, blockId }` is rendered as a visual "queued switch" cue but never edited by the UI. | EC-EDIT-014; §10 DTO save-failed arm |
| RD-019 | Slash-menu local state | Slash-menu open/close, query string, and selected index are local `$state` in the impure shell only. They never enter the reducer or the snapshot. | REQ-EDIT-010; NFR-EDIT-008 |
| RD-020 | Drag preview local state | The DnD preview node is local DOM owned by the impure shell. The pure reducer accepts only the final `MoveBlock` command via the dispatch path. | REQ-EDIT-011 |
| RD-021 | Block list ownership in `EditingSessionStateDto` | Option (a) chosen: `EditingSessionStateDto` non-idle arms carry an optional `blocks?: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; type: BlockType; content: string }>` DTO projection field. When present, `editorReducer` mirrors it into `EditorViewState.blocks` on `DomainSnapshotReceived`; when absent (e.g., in tests or legacy snapshots), the reducer preserves the current `state.blocks`. `EditorPanel.svelte` replaces local `blocks: Block[]` with `$derived(viewState.blocks)`. This eliminates the FIND-066 ambiguity where local block list state diverged from domain snapshots. The `idle` arm carries no `blocks` field; the panel clears to `[]` on `idle`. | FIND-066; §10 |
| RD-022 | `REQ-EDIT-038` error surface: DTO vs. dispatch rejection | Block validation errors (`BlockOperationError`, `BlockContentError`) are surfaced via Promise rejection from the `dispatchXxx` methods (not via snapshot DTO fields). `EditorPanel.svelte` holds a local `$state` `currentBlockError: { blockId: string; error: { kind: string; max?: number } } \| null`. This field is impure shell state only and never enters the pure reducer or `EditorViewState`. The choice avoids extending `EditingSessionStateDto` with per-block error data that the Rust backend may not emit. | REQ-EDIT-038; FIND-066 |

## 10. Domain ↔ UI State Synchronization

This section documents the inbound channel and the wire-format DTO between the Rust domain and the TypeScript UI.

### Outbound commands (TypeScript → Rust)

`EditorIpcAdapter` outbound methods (one per `EditorCommand` variant — see §10 of `verification-architecture.md`):

- `adapter.dispatchFocusBlock(noteId: string, blockId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchEditBlockContent(noteId: string, blockId: string, content: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchInsertBlockAfter(noteId: string, prevBlockId: string, type: BlockType, content: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchInsertBlockAtBeginning(noteId: string, type: BlockType, content: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchRemoveBlock(noteId: string, blockId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchMergeBlocks(noteId: string, blockId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchSplitBlock(noteId: string, blockId: string, offset: number, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchChangeBlockType(noteId: string, blockId: string, newType: BlockType, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchMoveBlock(noteId: string, blockId: string, toIndex: number, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchTriggerIdleSave(noteId: string, source: 'capture-idle', issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchTriggerBlurSave(noteId: string, source: 'capture-blur', issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchCopyNoteBody(noteId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchRequestNewNote(source: 'explicit-button' | 'ctrl-N', issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchRetrySave(noteId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchDiscardCurrentSession(noteId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`
- `adapter.dispatchCancelSwitch(noteId: string, issuedAt: string): Promise<void>`

All `issuedAt` values are ISO-8601 strings generated by the impure shell. Pure-tier modules never call `new Date()` or `Date.now()`.

> **Wire-boundary source-field note** (FIND-032): `dispatchTriggerIdleSave` and `dispatchTriggerBlurSave` carry a `source` parameter. The canonical `CaptureCommand.TriggerIdleSave` / `CaptureCommand.TriggerBlurSave` in `capture/commands.ts` do NOT have a `source` field — the source lives downstream on the `SaveNoteRequested` Public Domain Event, where the Rust `BuildSaveNoteRequested` helper uses it. The `source` parameter in these adapter signatures is an additional field sent over the Tauri IPC payload so the Rust handler can construct `SaveNoteRequested.source` correctly. The `EditorCommand` variants `trigger-idle-save` / `trigger-blur-save` carry `source` for pure-tier assertability (PROP-EDIT-002) and for IPC forwarding; the Rust intermediate command object does not store it.

### Inbound state updates (Rust → TypeScript)

The Rust backend emits `editing_session_state_changed` whenever `EditingSessionState` transitions. The payload shape is `{ state: EditingSessionStateDto }`. The DTO carries:

```typescript
type EditingSessionStateDto =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | {
      status: 'editing';
      currentNoteId: string;
      focusedBlockId: string | null;
      isDirty: boolean;
      isNoteEmpty: boolean;
      lastSaveResult: 'success' | 'failed' | null;
      /**
       * DTO projection field (RD-021): canonical rendered block list. When present,
       * the editorReducer mirrors this into EditorViewState.blocks on DomainSnapshotReceived.
       * When absent (legacy snapshots / tests), the reducer preserves state.blocks.
       */
      blocks?: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; type: BlockType; content: string }>;
    }
  | {
      status: 'saving';
      currentNoteId: string;
      /**
       * DTO projection field — not present on `SavingState` Rust aggregate
       * (`capture/states.ts` carries only `status`, `currentNoteId`, `savingStartedAt`).
       * The IPC emission layer populates this by running `NoteOps.isEmpty(currentNote)`
       * at snapshot time (or holding over the value from the preceding `EditingState`
       * snapshot).
       */
      isNoteEmpty: boolean;
      /** DTO projection field (RD-021). See editing arm for semantics. */
      blocks?: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; type: BlockType; content: string }>;
    }
  | {
      status: 'switching';
      currentNoteId: string;
      pendingNextFocus: { noteId: string; blockId: string };
      /**
       * DTO projection field — not present on `SwitchingState` Rust aggregate.
       * The IPC emission layer populates this by running `NoteOps.isEmpty(currentNote)`
       * at snapshot time (or holding over the value from the preceding `EditingState`
       * snapshot).
       */
      isNoteEmpty: boolean;
      /** DTO projection field (RD-021). See editing arm for semantics. */
      blocks?: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; type: BlockType; content: string }>;
    }
  | {
      status: 'save-failed';
      currentNoteId: string;
      /**
       * DTO-only projection field. The canonical `SaveFailedState` in `capture/states.ts`
       * does NOT carry `focusedBlockId`. This field is populated by the Rust IPC emission
       * layer: it carries the `focusedBlockId` from the immediately preceding `EditingState`
       * (captured before the `saving → save-failed` transition) so the UI can restore DOM
       * focus when the user clicks Cancel (REQ-EDIT-029). Named `priorFocusedBlockId` to
       * distinguish it from the live `focusedBlockId` on the `editing` arm.
       */
      priorFocusedBlockId: string | null;
      pendingNextFocus: { noteId: string; blockId: string } | null;
      lastSaveError: SaveError;
      /**
       * DTO projection field — not present on `SaveFailedState` Rust aggregate.
       * The IPC emission layer populates this by running `NoteOps.isEmpty(currentNote)`
       * at snapshot time (or holding over the value from the preceding `EditingState`
       * snapshot).
       */
      isNoteEmpty: boolean;
      /** DTO projection field (RD-021). See editing arm for semantics. */
      blocks?: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; type: BlockType; content: string }>;
    };
```

`editorStateChannel.ts` implements `subscribeToState(handler: (state: EditingSessionStateDto) => void): () => void` by calling `@tauri-apps/api/event listen('editing_session_state_changed', ...)` and returning an unlisten cleanup. This module is the sole inbound channel; `tauriEditorAdapter.ts` handles outbound `invoke(...)` only.

The impure shell stores the latest snapshot in a `$state` and feeds it through `editorReducer({ kind: 'DomainSnapshotReceived', snapshot })`.

### Test contract for integration tests

Integration tests inject a hand-rolled mock `EditorIpcAdapter` exposing `subscribe(callback)` / `emit(state)` and `vi.fn()` for every outbound dispatch method. No integration test calls real `invoke()`.

---

## 11. Brand Type Construction Contracts

Per `ui-fields.md §重要設計前提` and `shared/value-objects.ts`: `NoteId`, `BlockId`, `BlockContent`, `Body`, `Tag`, `Frontmatter`, `Timestamp`, `VaultPath` are **not constructible in TypeScript** (Brand + unique symbol). The UI sends raw `string` / `number` values over Tauri; Rust constructs branded types via `try_new_*`.

### Command wire-format types

| Command field | Type at UI boundary | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `noteId` | `string` | From `EditorViewState.currentNoteId` |
| `blockId` | `string` | From `EditorViewState.focusedBlockId` or hit-tested DOM node |
| `content` (EditBlockContent / InsertBlock) | `string` | Raw text; Rust runs `BlockContentSmartCtor` |
| `type` (InsertBlock / ChangeBlockType) | `BlockType` literal union | One of the 9 literals in `value-objects.ts` |
| `offset` (SplitBlock) | `number` | Caret index from `Selection.anchorOffset` |
| `toIndex` (MoveBlock) | `number` | 0-based destination index |
| `issuedAt` | `string` | ISO-8601 generated by impure shell |
| `source` (RequestNewNote) | `'explicit-button' | 'ctrl-N'` | Literal union |

### Predicates at the predicate boundary

`canCopy(view: EditorViewState): boolean` reads `view.isNoteEmpty` (already a `boolean` from the DTO) and `view.status` (literal union). It does NOT operate on branded `Body` / `BlockContent` values.

### Brand IDs in `EditorViewState`

The following appear as opaque `string`-typed fields inside `EditorViewState`:
- `currentNoteId: string | null`
- `focusedBlockId: string | null`
- `pendingNextFocus: { noteId: string; blockId: string } | null`

No `Body`, `Timestamp`, or `BlockContent` brand types are constructed in the TypeScript editor.

---

## 12. Debounce Contract

### Pure function signature

`debounceSchedule.computeNextFireAt({ lastEditAt: number, lastSaveAt: number, debounceMs: number, nowMs: number }): { shouldFire: boolean, fireAt: number | null }`

- `shouldFire === true` iff `lastEditAt + debounceMs <= nowMs` AND no save has occurred since the last edit.
- `fireAt` is the absolute ms timestamp the timer should fire, or `null`.
- `nowMs` is supplied by the caller; the function never calls `Date.now()`.

`debounceSchedule.shouldFireIdleSave(editTimestamps: readonly number[], lastSaveTimestamp: number, debounceMs: number, nowMs: number): boolean` — companion predicate for property tests.

### Shell pattern

On each block-edit dispatch (`EditBlockContent`, `InsertBlock`, `RemoveBlock`, `MergeBlocks`, `SplitBlock`, `ChangeBlockType`, `MoveBlock`):
1. The shell calls `timerModule.cancelIdleSave(currentHandle)`.
2. The shell computes `{ fireAt } = computeNextFireAt({ lastEditAt, lastSaveAt, debounceMs: IDLE_SAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS, nowMs: clock.now() })`.
3. If `fireAt !== null`, the shell calls `timerModule.scheduleIdleSave(fireAt - clock.now(), () => dispatch(TriggerIdleSave))`.
4. The shell stores only `lastEditTimestamp`.

### Property test model

PROP-EDIT-003 / PROP-EDIT-004 use `shouldFireIdleSave` to enumerate boundary cases.

## 14. Migration Notes from Sprint 1–6

The previous (Sprint 1–6) `ui-editor` spec was anchored on a single textarea + `EditNoteBody` model. This Sprint 7 respec replaces that surface with the block-based contract introduced on `feature/inplace-edit-migration`. The substantive deltas:

- `EditNoteBody` → 8 block-operation commands + `FocusBlock` (REQ-EDIT-001..011).
- `NoteBodyEdited` Internal Event → 9 block-level Internal Events (`BlockFocused`, `BlockBlurred`, `EditorBlurredAllBlocks`, `BlockContentEdited`, `BlockInserted`, `BlockRemoved`, `BlocksMerged`, `BlockSplit`, `BlockTypeChanged`, `BlockMoved`).
- `EditingState.focusedBlockId` and `EditingSessionTransitions.refocusBlockSameNote` become first-class spec concepts (REQ-EDIT-001 / 017 / 018).
- `pendingNextNoteId` → `pendingNextFocus: { noteId, blockId }` (capture/states.ts L14).
- `Body.isEmptyAfterTrim` → `note.isEmpty()` mirrored as `EditorViewState.isNoteEmpty` (RD-006).
- New `BlockType` literal union (`paragraph | heading-1..3 | bullet | numbered | code | quote | divider`) drives slash menu and Markdown shortcut decisions (REQ-EDIT-010).
- `serializeBlocksToMarkdown(note.blocks)` is the source of `body` for `SaveNoteRequested` / `bodyForClipboard`; the UI never re-implements serialisation.
- `HydrationFailureReason` gains `'block-parse'`; `ui-editor` defers Hydration to `app-startup`.
- `SwitchError.pendingNextFocus` carries `(noteId, blockId)`; the Cancel button restores the prior block (RD-018).

The numbering of REQ / EC IDs has been re-issued to match the new logical layout (REQ-EDIT-001..038, EC-EDIT-001..014). Prior IDs are not preserved across the respec — implementation, tests, contracts, and Phase 5 audit artefacts will be re-keyed during Sprint 7 TDD.

## 15. Sprint 8 — IPC Payload Rust Block Migration (Option B)

**Sprint**: 8
**Profile**: Rust (`promptnotes/src-tauri/`) + TypeScript boundary verification
**Source of truth (additions)**:
- `promptnotes/src-tauri/src/editor.rs` — Rust IPC handlers and `EditingSessionStateDto` definition (current Sprint-7 6-flat-field shape)
- `promptnotes/src-tauri/src/feed.rs::select_past_note` — sole non-`editor.rs` caller of `make_editing_state_changed_payload`
- `promptnotes/src/lib/editor/types.ts:99-162` — TS `EditingSessionStateDto` 5-arm tagged union (the wire contract Sprint 8 anchors on)
- `promptnotes/src/lib/editor/editorStateChannel.ts:22-40` — INBOUND channel that decodes `event.payload.state` into the TS union
- `docs/tasks/ipc-payload-rust-block-migration.md` — Sprint 8 instruction (Option B: Rust full 5-arm migration)

### 15.1 Background and scope

Sprint 7 migrated the TS-side `EditingSessionStateDto` to a 5-arm discriminated union (`idle | editing | saving | switching | save-failed`) that carries block-aware fields (`focusedBlockId`, `pendingNextFocus`, `priorFocusedBlockId`, optional `blocks`). The Rust side, however, kept the legacy 6-flat-field DTO (`status, isDirty, currentNoteId, pendingNextNoteId, lastError, body`) and the `make_editing_state_changed_payload(status, isDirty, currentNoteId, pendingNextNoteId, lastError, body)` constructor. The two shapes are wire-incompatible: any payload emitted from Rust today fails the TS type-guard's discriminated-union narrowing for arms other than the legacy ones, and the Rust side has no way to express `focusedBlockId` / `priorFocusedBlockId` / `pendingNextFocus` / `blocks`.

Sprint 8's scope is the **big-bang migration** of the Rust DTO and all Rust callers to the 5-arm tagged union. TS-side application logic (reducer, view-state, DOM tests) is **out of scope** except where the channel contract changes.

### 15.2 IPC wire contract requirements (REQ-IPC-001..020) {#sprint-8-req-ipc}

> **Note (post Phase-1c iter-1):** REQ-IPC-004..007 were rewritten in iter-2 from the original "shall additionally contain X / shall NOT contain Y" form to a positive **exact-key-set** form, in response to FIND-075 / FIND-076. Each variant requirement now enumerates the complete present-key set; PROP-IPC-004..006 enforce equality (not subset) of the JSON object's key set.

#### Tag and variant shape

- **REQ-IPC-001** — When the Rust backend emits `editing_session_state_changed`, the wrapped `state` JSON object shall be a tagged union whose discriminant is the field name `status`, with one of the literal kebab-case string values `"idle"`, `"editing"`, `"saving"`, `"switching"`, `"save-failed"`.
- **REQ-IPC-002** — Each non-`idle` variant shall carry a `currentNoteId: string` field. The `idle` variant shall NOT carry `currentNoteId`.
- **REQ-IPC-003** — Each non-`idle` variant shall carry an `isNoteEmpty: boolean` field. The `idle` variant shall NOT carry `isNoteEmpty`.
- **REQ-IPC-004** — When an emitted state is the `editing` variant, the JSON object shall contain **exactly** the keys `status`, `currentNoteId`, `focusedBlockId`, `isDirty`, `isNoteEmpty`, `lastSaveResult`, and (when the optional `blocks` field is `Some`) `blocks` — and no other keys. The `focusedBlockId` field shall be `string | null` (always present); the `lastSaveResult` field shall be `"success" | null` (always present).
- **REQ-IPC-005** — When an emitted state is the `saving` variant, the JSON object shall contain **exactly** the keys `status`, `currentNoteId`, `isNoteEmpty`, and (when the optional `blocks` field is `Some`) `blocks` — and no other keys. Keys `isDirty`, `focusedBlockId`, `pendingNextFocus`, `priorFocusedBlockId`, `lastSaveResult`, and `lastSaveError` shall be absent.
- **REQ-IPC-006** — When an emitted state is the `switching` variant, the JSON object shall contain **exactly** the keys `status`, `currentNoteId`, `pendingNextFocus`, `isNoteEmpty`, and (when the optional `blocks` field is `Some`) `blocks` — and no other keys. The `pendingNextFocus` field shall be `{ noteId: string, blockId: string }` (always present, never null in this variant).
- **REQ-IPC-007** — When an emitted state is the `save-failed` variant, the JSON object shall contain **exactly** the keys `status`, `currentNoteId`, `priorFocusedBlockId`, `pendingNextFocus`, `lastSaveError`, `isNoteEmpty`, and (when the optional `blocks` field is `Some`) `blocks` — and no other keys. `priorFocusedBlockId` shall be `string | null` (always present); `pendingNextFocus` shall be `{ noteId, blockId } | null` (always present); `lastSaveError` shall be a `SaveErrorDto` (always present).

#### Sub-DTO shapes

- **REQ-IPC-008** — `PendingNextFocusDto` shall serialize as `{ "noteId": string, "blockId": string }` (camelCase, both fields required).
- **REQ-IPC-009** — `DtoBlock` shall serialize as `{ "id": string, "type": string, "content": string }`. The Rust `block_type` field shall be of type `BlockTypeDto` (per §15.5) and shall serialize under the JSON key `type`, with serde rename rules producing the 9 kebab-case literals. Permitted `type` values mirror the TS `BlockType` literal union (`paragraph | heading-1 | heading-2 | heading-3 | bullet | numbered | code | quote | divider`).
- **REQ-IPC-010** — `SaveErrorDto` shall serialize as `{ "kind": "fs" | "validation", "reason"?: { "kind": "permission" | "disk-full" | "lock" | "not-found" | "unknown" } }`. When `reason` is `None`, the JSON key shall be omitted (`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`).

#### Optionality rules

- **REQ-IPC-011** — When the optional `blocks` field on the `editing` / `saving` / `switching` / `save-failed` variant is `None`, the JSON key `blocks` shall be omitted from the serialized object. When it is `Some(vec)`, the JSON key shall be present and carry an array of `DtoBlock` (possibly empty).
- **REQ-IPC-012** — All `editing_session_state_changed` events shall carry the payload wrapper `{ "state": <variant object> }` (ie the existing `make_editing_state_changed_payload` wrapping contract).

#### Caller-site contracts

- **REQ-IPC-013** — All emit sites in `promptnotes/src-tauri/src/editor.rs` (`save_note_and_emit`, `discard_current_session`, `cancel_switch`, `request_new_note`) shall construct payloads through the new variant-aware helper API. No emit site shall hand-construct a flat 6-field object.
- **REQ-IPC-014** — `promptnotes/src-tauri/src/feed.rs::select_past_note` shall emit `editing_session_state_changed` with the `editing` variant. The emitted variant shall set `currentNoteId` to the selected note id, `focusedBlockId: null`, `isDirty: false`, `lastSaveResult: null`, and `isNoteEmpty: body.is_empty()`. Resolution of the actual focus target on the editor side is the responsibility of the TS-side `EditorPanel` when block-aware emission is enabled in `ui-feed-list-actions` Sprint 4 (which will populate `blocks` and supersede this requirement). Sprint 8's Rust handler shall NOT attempt to compute a `Block.id` from raw markdown bytes — block parsing remains out-of-scope per §15.4.
- **REQ-IPC-015** — `cancel_switch` shall emit the `editing` variant for the cancelled `currentNoteId`, with `isDirty: true`, `focusedBlockId: null`, `lastSaveResult: null`, and `isNoteEmpty: false`. The Rust handler does NOT participate in focus restoration: it has no session state and no prior-focus knowledge. Restoration of the cursor to the previously focused block is owned by the TS-side `EditorPanel.svelte` impure-shell local state (`currentBlockError` / DOM focus management documented in `behavioral-spec.md §3.6a` and `RD-022`), which retains the last-focused block id outside the reducer. This Sprint 8 wire contract is therefore intentionally focus-agnostic; the Sprint 7 RD-018 behaviour is unchanged. PROP-EDIT-040's idle-default fallback (which zeros `focusedBlockId` on the `editing` arm when the snapshot omits it) is NOT relied upon for cancel-switch focus restoration — the TS reducer's `state.focusedBlockId` may legitimately end up as `null` on this transition, and the Svelte component layer is responsible for re-focusing the prior block via its own retained reference.
- **REQ-IPC-016** — `discard_current_session` shall emit the `idle` variant. The serialized state object shall contain only `{"status":"idle"}` and no other fields.
- **REQ-IPC-017** — `trigger_idle_save`, `trigger_blur_save`, and `retry_save` shall emit the `editing` variant on `Ok(())` from `fs_write_file_atomic` (with `isDirty: false`, `focusedBlockId: null`, `lastSaveResult: "success"`, `isNoteEmpty: body.is_empty()`), and the `save-failed` variant on `Err(io_err)` (with `priorFocusedBlockId: null`, `pendingNextFocus: null`, `lastSaveError: { kind: "fs", reason: <FsErrorDto> }`, `isNoteEmpty: body.is_empty()`). **Known Sprint-8 regression vs Sprint-7 RD-018:** the current Rust signatures (`note_id, body, issued_at, source`) do not carry the queued `pendingNextFocus` from the TS side, so Sprint 8 emits `pendingNextFocus: null` on the save-failed arm even when the save was triggered while a switch was queued. The TS reducer is therefore responsible for re-emitting the queued switch on retry/cancel paths from its own retained state. Restoration of `pendingNextFocus` propagation through these IPC handlers is explicitly deferred to a follow-up sprint (Sprint 9 or `ui-feed-list-actions` Sprint 4) and is tracked as a known limitation in `docs/tasks/ipc-payload-rust-block-migration.md` §履歴.
- **REQ-IPC-018** — `request_new_note` shall emit the `editing` variant for the newly-created note path with `isDirty: false`, `focusedBlockId: null`, `lastSaveResult: null`, `isNoteEmpty: true` (new note has empty body).

#### Boundary contracts

- **REQ-IPC-019** — `promptnotes/src/lib/editor/editorStateChannel.ts::subscribeToEditorState` shall continue to type the listener as `(state: EditingSessionStateDto) => void` and read `event.payload.state` without modification. Sprint 8 shall NOT introduce a runtime type-guard or coercion at the channel boundary; correctness is established by the wire contract above plus the Phase 5 round-trip property.
- **REQ-IPC-020** — For every Rust emit-site listed in REQ-IPC-013 and REQ-IPC-014, `serde_json::to_string(&dto)` followed by parsing back into the Rust `EditingSessionStateDto` enum shall be the identity (round-trip preservation). Equivalently, the JSON output of the Rust serializer, when fed into a `JSON.parse`-then-`EditingSessionStateDto` narrowing in TypeScript, shall successfully match exactly one of the 5 union arms with no extra fields the TS `EditingSessionStateDto` does not declare.

### 15.3 Edge cases (EC-IPC-001..014)

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| EC-IPC-001 | Save success (`fs_write_file_atomic` returns `Ok(())`): emitted variant is `editing`, **not** `idle`. The TS reducer relies on `editing` to keep the editor mounted. |
| EC-IPC-002 | `lastSaveError.reason` is `None` (validation error): the JSON shall NOT contain the `reason` key (`skip_serializing_if`). |
| EC-IPC-003 | `lastSaveError.reason` is `Some(FsErrorDto { kind: "permission" })`: serialized shape is `{"kind":"fs","reason":{"kind":"permission"}}`. |
| EC-IPC-004 | `blocks` is `None` (Sprint 8 default for backwards-compatible emits): the JSON object shall NOT contain `blocks`. |
| EC-IPC-005 | `blocks` is `Some(vec![])` (note with no blocks): the JSON object shall contain `"blocks":[]`. |
| EC-IPC-006 | `priorFocusedBlockId` is `null` in `save-failed`: the JSON shall serialize the literal `"priorFocusedBlockId":null` (NOT skip), to match the TS narrowing of `priorFocusedBlockId: string \| null` (always present). |
| EC-IPC-007 | `focusedBlockId` is `null` in `editing`: the JSON shall serialize `"focusedBlockId":null` (always present, NOT skipped) — same reason as EC-IPC-006. |
| EC-IPC-008 | `pendingNextFocus` is `null` in `save-failed`: the JSON shall serialize `"pendingNextFocus":null` (always present in this variant; NOT skipped). |
| EC-IPC-009 | TS reducer receives an emitted `idle` variant: matching narrows on `state.status === 'idle'`. The Rust JSON `{"status":"idle"}` (no other fields) shall successfully narrow under TS's union narrowing without runtime errors. |
| EC-IPC-010 | `select_past_note` is called for a note whose body is empty (`""`): emitted `editing` variant shall have `focusedBlockId: null` and `isNoteEmpty: true`. (Body parsing into blocks for the `blocks` field is OUT-OF-SCOPE in Sprint 8 and shall remain `None`.) |
| EC-IPC-011 | `select_past_note(noteId)` for a `noteId` whose entry is missing from `scan_vault_feed`'s `note_metadata` (file unreadable / disappeared mid-scan in `feed.rs::scan_vault_feed`): the body lookup at `feed.rs:257` resolves to `""` via `unwrap_or("")`. Emitted `editing` variant shall carry `currentNoteId: noteId`, `focusedBlockId: null`, `isDirty: false`, `lastSaveResult: null`, `isNoteEmpty: true`. The TS-side EditorPanel decides downstream whether to surface a "missing note" affordance — the Rust IPC contract is silent on the missing-file case beyond emitting an empty editing snapshot. |
| EC-IPC-012 | `cancel_switch` is invoked when the prior emitted state was `switching` (not `save-failed`) — i.e. the user pressed Cancel on a switch confirmation before any save was attempted. The Rust handler still emits the `editing` variant with `focusedBlockId: null` per REQ-IPC-015. The TS reducer/EditorPanel must NOT assume a `priorFocusedBlockId` exists in this branch; focus restoration falls back to the EditorPanel's last-known DOM focus reference (RD-022) or, if absent, to the document's natural tab order. |
| EC-IPC-013 | `body` consists of whitespace only (e.g. `"\n"`, `"  "`, `"\n\n   \n"`): `body.is_empty()` returns `false` so the emitted variant carries `isNoteEmpty: false`. **This intentionally diverges from `NoteOps.isEmpty()`** (TS domain) which treats whitespace-only as empty. Sprint 8 documents this as a known divergence: the canonical `note.isEmpty()` evaluation is owned by `capture-auto-save` once block parsing crosses the IPC boundary; the Sprint-8 byte-level check is a conservative under-approximation chosen because it is computable from raw `String` without parser support. |
| EC-IPC-014 | `request_new_note` (or any other emit-site) is invoked during cold start before the TS-side `subscribeToEditorState` listener has registered with `@tauri-apps/api/event::listen`: Tauri events are not buffered, so the emit is dropped. The TS-side caller (svelte component lifecycle) shall ensure the listener is attached before invoking any IPC command that would emit `editing_session_state_changed`. Compliance is an `EditorPanel.svelte` mount-order obligation; the Rust IPC contract assumes the subscriber is ready. The wire shape is unchanged. |

### 15.4 Out-of-scope for Sprint 8 (explicit)

- Block parsing on the Rust side (`parseMarkdownToBlocks` analogue): Sprint 8 emits `blocks: None` from all Rust handlers. Block-aware payload emission from `select_past_note` is deferred to `ui-feed-list-actions` Sprint 4.
- TS-side reducer / view-state changes: the TS layer is already block-aware.
- New REQ-EDIT requirements: this sprint is wire-contract only and does not alter the user-visible behaviour of `ui-editor` (REQ-EDIT-001..038 remain authoritative).
- `note.isEmpty()` evaluation on the Rust side from raw bytes: Sprint 8 emits `isNoteEmpty = body.is_empty()` as a conservative byte-level check; richer block-based emptiness (whitespace-only) is owned by `capture-auto-save`.

### 15.5 Migration deltas vs Sprint 7

- `EditingSessionStateDto` (Rust): `struct { status, is_dirty, current_note_id, pending_next_note_id, last_error, body }` → `enum` with 5 variants (`Idle | Editing { … } | Saving { … } | Switching { … } | SaveFailed { … }`) using `#[serde(tag = "status", rename_all = "kebab-case")]`.
- **Helper API (singular form pinned)**: `make_editing_state_changed_payload(status, isDirty, currentNoteId, pendingNextNoteId, lastError, body)` (8 positional args, all required) → a single helper `pub fn make_editing_state_changed_payload(state: &EditingSessionStateDto) -> serde_json::Value` that wraps the enum in `{"state": <state>}`. Sprint 8 pins the singular helper shape (rather than per-variant constructors): it composes naturally with the enum, eliminates duplicate emit-site wiring, and is the form referenced by PROP-IPC-009 / PROP-IPC-012. Per-variant constructors are explicitly NOT used in Sprint 8.
- The `body` parameter on the legacy helper is **removed** from the public API: the Rust DTO no longer carries `body`. **Body delivery routing**: past-note bodies for the editor are delivered via `feed_state_changed.note_metadata[noteId].body` (already populated by `feed.rs::scan_vault_feed` and consumed by the TS-side EditorPanel via the feed snapshot pipeline). Sprint 8 explicitly does NOT re-introduce a `body` field on the editor channel; the `editing_session_state_changed` event communicates only state/wire-shape information, while the body content travels on the `feed_state_changed` channel. Cross-feature dependency on `ui-feed-list-actions` (specifically the `note_metadata` map's `body` field) is pinned by this delta.
- **Forbidden serde annotations on focus fields**: The Rust enum-variant fields `Editing::focused_block_id: Option<String>`, `SaveFailed::prior_focused_block_id: Option<String>`, and `SaveFailed::pending_next_focus: Option<PendingNextFocusDto>` MUST NOT carry `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`. These fields shall serialize the literal JSON `null` when `None`, matching the TS narrowing of `string | null` / `PendingNextFocus | null` (always-present, nullable) on the corresponding union arms. The skip annotation is permitted ONLY on the optional `blocks: Option<Vec<DtoBlock>>` field on each non-idle variant (REQ-IPC-011) and on `SaveErrorDto::reason: Option<FsErrorDto>` (REQ-IPC-010). A Phase 5 grep audit shall fail if any other field carries `skip_serializing_if`.
- **`BlockTypeDto` enum (typed block type)**: Sprint 8's `DtoBlock` shall serialize `type` from a typed Rust enum `BlockTypeDto` with the 9 variants `Paragraph | Heading1 | Heading2 | Heading3 | Bullet | Numbered | Code | Quote | Divider`, using `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` plus `#[serde(rename = "heading-1")]` / `"heading-2"` / `"heading-3"` to match the TS `BlockType` literal union. Using a raw `String` for `block_type` (the original sketch in `docs/tasks/ipc-payload-rust-block-migration.md`'s 想定 Rust DTO 構造 §) is rejected for Sprint 8 because it admits invalid round-trip values (typo'd block types) that would silently cross the wire and structurally typecheck on the TS side without runtime error. Round-trip safety is delegated to `serde_json::from_str::<BlockTypeDto>("\"hedaing-1\"")` returning `Err`.
- Tests in `src-tauri/tests/editor_handlers.rs` and `src-tauri/tests/feed_handlers.rs` that assert the legacy 6-flat-field JSON keys (`isDirty`, `currentNoteId`, `pendingNextNoteId`, `lastError`, `body`) are rewritten to assert the corresponding variant-shape keys, OR the assertion is loosened to `status` + `currentNoteId` per the Sprint 8 instruction document §影響範囲リスト.

### 15.6 Acceptance signals

- `cargo test --manifest-path promptnotes/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` shall PASS (existing tests rewritten to new shape + new round-trip and per-variant serde tests).
- `bun run vitest run` (TS) shall PASS — DOM tests for `EditorPanel` / `editorStateChannel` shall remain green without source changes outside scope.
- `bun run tauri dev` smoke: opening a past note via the feed shall populate the editor with the correct body (REQ-IPC-014 manual check).
